Categorization & Tagging: Implement a robust system for categorizing products (e.g., "Jewelry," "Pottery," "Textiles") and adding relevant tags (e.g., "Hand-painted," "Organic Cotton," "Limited Edition") for easy filtering and searching.
Recipe/Process Tracking: For complex items, allow storing the "recipe" or steps involved in making the product, including material quantities and estimated time. This can help with cost calculation and production planning.
Pricing Rules & Discounts: Implement the ability to set tiered pricing, bulk discounts, seasonal sales, and promotional codes.
Product Bundles: Allow creating and managing product bundles with special pricing.
Digital Asset Management: Integrate a way to store and link product photos, videos, and even care instructions.

Supplier Management: Maintain a database of suppliers for raw materials, including contact information, pricing, lead times, and past orders.
Purchase Order Generation: Allow creating and managing purchase orders for restocking materials.
Inventory Valuation Reports: Generate reports on the total value of the current inventory.

Customer Relationship Management (CRM):

Customer Database: Store customer contact information, purchase history, order preferences, and potentially notes on interactions.
Customer Segmentation: Allow categorizing customers based on purchase history, interests, or other criteria for targeted communication.
Loyalty Programs: Implement a system for rewarding repeat customers with discounts or special offers.

II. Employee & Admin Specific Features:

Employee Management (Admin Only):

User Account Creation & Management: Create, edit, and deactivate employee and admin accounts.
Role-Based Access Control: Precisely define the permissions and functionalities accessible to each role (e.g., employee can only manage orders and update product stock, while admin can manage everything).
Activity Logs: Track employee logins, actions performed within the system, and any modifications made to data.
Admin Dashboard:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Display a visual overview of important business metrics like total sales, order volume, low stock items, pending orders, and customer growth over different time periods.

Offline Mode (Potentially): If feasible, consider allowing some basic functionalities to work offline, with data synchronization when an internet connection is restored.
Integration with Local Hardware:
Barcode Scanner Support: For efficient inventory management and order processing.
Label Printing: For printing product labels or shipping labels.
Audit Trails: Maintain detailed logs of all data modifications, including who made the change and when. This is crucial for accountability.
Creative & Unique Ideas:

"Maker's Corner" Module: A space to document the inspiration, stories, and processes behind specific handmade items. This can add a personal touch and marketing value.
